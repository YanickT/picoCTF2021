# Most Cookies

## Description
Alright, enough of using my own encryption. Flask session cookies should be plenty secure! server.py http://mercury.picoctf.net:35697/

## Hints
1. How secure is a flask cookie?

## Solution
In `server.py` we find a list. We know that the secret key is one of them.
We thus modify a script found at: https://gist.github.com/aescalana/7e0bc39b95baa334074707f73bc64bfe
to determine which key was used. Afterwards we use this key to create a new cookie with the value `admin` in 
`very_auth`. Finally, we insert the result into our cookie and reload the website.
The flag reads:

`picoCTF{pwn_4ll_th3_cook1E5_22fe0842}`
