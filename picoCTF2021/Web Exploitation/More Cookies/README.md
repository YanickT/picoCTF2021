# More Cookies

## Description
I forgot Cookies can Be modified Client-side, so now I decided to encrypt them! http://mercury.picoctf.net:56136/

## Hints
1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption
2. The search endpoint is only helpful for telling you if you are admin or not, you won't be able to guess the flag name

## Solution
Due to the first hint I guess the encrypted cookie contains a bit for admin. 
We use the homomorphic encryption and simply try to flip it using the or operation.

Since the position of the bit is yet unknown all positions must be tested till the flag is received.
