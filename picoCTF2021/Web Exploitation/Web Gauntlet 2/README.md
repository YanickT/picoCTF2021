# Web Gauntlet 2

## Description
This website looks familiar... Log in as admin Site: http://mercury.picoctf.net:21336/ Filter: http://mercury.picoctf.net:21336/filter.php

## Hints
- I tried to make it a little bit less contrived since the mini competition.
- Each filter is separated by a space. Spaces are not filtered.
- There is only 1 round this time, when you beat it the flag will be in filter.php.
- There is a length component now.
- sqlite

## Solution
The filter tells us that the following words are not allowed:
```Filters: or and true false union like = > < ; -- /* */ admin```

A list of orders can be found at:

Using the script we get `solution.php`
and thus the flag:

`picoCTF{0n3_m0r3_t1m3_838ec9084e6e0a65e4632329e7abc585}`
