# It is my Birthday

## Description
I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites 
look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it 
took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website.

## Hints
1. Look at the category of this problem.
2. How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?

## Solution
Just searching for two colliding md5 hashes I found two pdfs at:
https://github.com/corkami/collisions/tree/master/examples/free

I uploaded both of them and got the flag.
