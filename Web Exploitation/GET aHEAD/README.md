#GET aHEAD

##Description
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/.

##Hints
1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices
2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses

##Solution
The first hint refers not to the colors of the website but the different methods instead.
Checking which methods are available the method "HEAD" seems pretty suspicious.

Writing three lines of python code solved the challenge and revealed the flag:

`picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_82880908}`
