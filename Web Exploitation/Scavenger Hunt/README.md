# Scavenger Hunt

## Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/. Can you find it?

## Hints
You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Solution
Checking the HTML-Code of the website I found:

`<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->`

Since the website consists of three different parts: HTML, JS, CSS.
I checked these and found the second part in CSS.
Unfortunately, holds the js only the comment:
"/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */"

A quick google search revels somethings with robots. 
Therefore, I checked the robots.txt and got part 3 as well as the hind:
"I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag"

Therefore, I checked the .htaccess and got part 4 as well as another hind:
"I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there."

So finally, I checked .DS_Store and got the last part.

The complete flag reads:

``picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_d375c750} ``
