## Solution
A quick search revels the website:
https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol7/html/Vlist02/BalisageVol7-Vlist02.html
where the general attack is explained. Its basic structure is:
`' or 0=0 or .='`.
Inserting this we get a `You're on the right path.` message.

Knowing this we can start to determine the password.
At first, we have to determine which user is the admin. 
Due to the names `name`, `pass` in the formula of the html code we expect the node names to match.


Therefore, we at first determine which user is the admin with the `main.py` script and the attack-string:
```attack = f"' or //user[{i}]/name ='admin' or .='"```
The loop breaks at `i=3` and thus the 4th user is the admin.

Afterwards, we try to determine the length of the password. Therefore, we use the script:
```' or string-length(//user[3]/pass)={i} or .='```
We get a length of `i=50` which means 51 chars.
