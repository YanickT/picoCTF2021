#Cookies

##Description
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:21485/

##Hints
None

##Solution
Since the challenge is called cookies i checked them out first.
You find a cookie with value -1. I changed this value to 0 and reload the page and got 
"I love snickerdoodle cookies!".

Trying it with some more values (2) I decided to use the attached python script.
The result reads:

`picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_94190c8a}`
