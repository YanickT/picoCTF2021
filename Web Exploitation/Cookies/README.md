## Hints
None

## Solution
Since the challenge is called cookies we checked them out first.
Finding a cookie with value -1. We changed this value to 0 and reload the page and got 
"I love snickerdoodle cookies!".

Trying it with some more values (2) we decided to use the attached python script.
The result reads:

`picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_94190c8a}`
