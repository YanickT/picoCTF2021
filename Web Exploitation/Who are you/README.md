#Who are you?

##Description
Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn http://mercury.picoctf.net:52362/

##Hints
It ain't much, but it's an RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616

##Solution
The solution is to modify the request header and finally get the flag.
I have to admit that I wasnt able to get an ip in sweden and looked this line up in another 
writeup.

A list of headers can be found here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers

Finally, I used python to modify the headers and send the requests. The flag reads:

`picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_0c0db339}`
